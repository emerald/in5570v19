\frametitle{Emerald Objects are Mobile}

\begin{itemize}

\item Mobility may affect system \textbf{performance}

\begin{itemize}

\item So long as all objects are on one machine, the overhead of a
method call or field access is negligible and predictable

\end{itemize}

\item Mobility may affect system \textbf{reliability}

\begin{itemize}

\item So long as all objects are on one machine, you only have to
worry about the life of that one machine

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}

As an object moves around, what about the objects it references?

\end{center}

\vspace{\fill}

\begin{itemize}

\item Making sure that a certain collection of objects is
\emph{always} co-located enables us to again make claims about the
\emph{performance} and \emph{reliability} of our code

\item The Emerald runtime \emph{may} move an object at any time.  \\
Hence, referenced objects \emph{may} move along, but this is
unreliable --- the Emerald runtime can only do so little

\end{itemize}

To this end, emerald has an \lstinline{attached} keyword

\end{center}

\begin{itemize}

\item Attached objects stick together

\end{itemize}
