\frametitle{What Is An Emerald Node?}

In the context of this course, an Emerald constitutes the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\footnotesize

\item Some general-purpose network-enabled hardware (laptop or server)

\item Running some general-purpose operating system (typically, Linux)

\item Having some associated IP address or hostname (e.g.,
\texttt{localhost})

\item Running an (old and dusty) Emerald virtual machine at a
designated port

\end{enumerate}

\vspace{\fill}

Hence, an Emerald node is uniquely identified by:

\begin{center}

\texttt{<host>:<port>}

\end{center}

where

\begin{itemize}

\footnotesize

\item \texttt{<host>} is an IP address or hostname, and

\item \texttt{<port>} is an integer between 0 and 65535.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
