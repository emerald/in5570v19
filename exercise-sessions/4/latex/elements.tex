\frametitle{Elements of Programming in This Course}

A refresher from Exercise Session 1:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Writing \textbf{programs}

\begin{itemize}

\footnotesize

\item Submit readable, preferably working code

\item Test your code, and tell us how to reproduce your test results

\item Refactor your code once it works, and before you submit

\end{itemize}

\item Writing programs in a \textbf{text-based} programming language

\begin{itemize}

\footnotesize

\item Use indentation to indicate program structure

\item Use adequate naming

\item Organize code into methods and classes

\item \sout{Organize code into files and directories} (Maybe later)

\item Apply other common elements of (text-based) programming style

\end{itemize}

\item Writing programs for \textbf{distributed} execution

\begin{itemize}

\footnotesize

\item Program fragments execute concurrently on (distant) nodes

\item Program fragments coordinate to get common tasks done

\item Nodes are unreliable (the software/hardware beneath you may fail)

\item Node-to-node communication is unreliable

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
